Description: This package contains functions for generating neat tables for statistical reports. There are functions for I-by-J frequency tables, comparison of means across levels of a categorical variable, and regression (linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards). The package is intended to make it easier for researchers to translate results from statistical analyses in R to their reports or manuscripts.
